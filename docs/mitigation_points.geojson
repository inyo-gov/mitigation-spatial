With flows constrained to 40 cfs, and occasional excursions up to 200 cfs, the river lacks the energy to move sediments onto its banks to create germination beds for trees. Additionally, these flows do not provide sufficient power to clear the river of accumulated muck and emergent vegetation. As a result, many areas of the river are partially or fully occluded by cattail and bulrush, and water quality has become a concern. When the river is tasked with handling storm flows much greater than 200 cfs, anaerobic muck is released from the riverbed, triggering a chain of events that can kill fish. The buildup of emergent vegetation also obstructs access for anglers and other recreationists. While new hydrograph proposals have been made, limitations such as the capacity of pumpback stations, infrastructure constraints at road crossings, and other challenges have prevented experimentation with higher flows and variable pulses. High flows, up to 1,200 cfs, and flooding in 2023-2024 scoured the riverbed and floodplain in place. These unplanned flows reached pre-LAA levels, and the water dynamics may have mobilized muck and created conditions favorable for tree recruitment and improved water quality.
